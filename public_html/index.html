        <p class="aboutInfo sideMargins">
          &emsp; As a child, I always loved coloring in coloring books. My 
          grandmother set aside a special spot for me to color, and 
          it became a place where I could escape and let my mind wander 
          to a happy place. My journey into painting on canvas, however, 
          didn't begin until I moved to Lake Havasu due to my husband's 
          job. Being a military spouse often means you're constantly on 
          the move, making it difficult to build a stable career. My main 
          profession had been as a massage therapist, and I’ve always seen 
          myself as a healer, with the goal of helping those around me.
          <br><br>
          &emsp; When we relocated for my husband’s job, I had to start my business 
          from scratch, which made it challenging to make new friends and 
          find stability. It was during this time that I met my friend 
          Jackie, who encouraged me to start painting while I was still 
          trying to establish my massage therapy practice. I quickly realized 
          that painting brought me a sense of calm and relief from the 
          anxiety that came with moving and starting over in a new place. 
          Painting became a way for me to heal, providing a creative outlet 
          that helped ease my worries and lifted me out of the depression 
          and stress of constant transitions. It took me back to that 
          happy place I had as a child, and I realized that painting, 
          for me, is a form of healing. My first paintings were two 4x5-foot 
          canvases. Both my husband and Jackie were a bit puzzled as to why 
          I’d start with such large canvases, but I needed a piece for the 
          expansive wall above the stairs in our home, so I didn’t even 
          consider painting something smaller. 
          <br><br>
          &emsp; My husband encouraged me to buy more canvas after completing my first 
          painting. This decision led me to start creating art for every wall 
          in our home. My massage clients began to notice and compliment my 
          paintings, and my family members also expressed their appreciation, 
          I gained more confidence in my work. I sold a few pieces and gave 
          many away to friends and family. When we moved cross-country from 
          Lake Havasu, the couple who bought our home purchased several of 
          my paintings, which were still hanging on the walls. This was the 
          start of my confidence in my artwork.
