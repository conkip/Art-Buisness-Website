                        &emsp; As a child, I always loved coloring in coloring
                        books. My grandmother set aside a special spot for me to
                        color, and it became a place where I could escape and
                        let my mind wander to a happy place. My journey into
                        painting on canvas, however, didn't begin until I moved
                        to Lake Havasu due to my husband's job.

                        <br /><br />

                        &emsp; Being a military spouse often means you're
                        constantly on the move, making it difficult to build a
                        stable career. My main profession had been as a massage
                        therapist, and I’ve always seen myself as a healer, with
                        the goal of helping those around me. When we relocated
                        for my husband’s job, I had to start my business from
                        scratch, which made it challenging to make new friends
                        and find stability. It was during this time that I met
                        my friend Jackie, who encouraged me to start painting
                        while I was still trying to establish my massage therapy
                        practice.

                        <br /><br />

                        &emsp; I quickly realized that painting brought me a
                        sense of calm and relief from the anxiety that came with
                        moving and starting over in a new place. Painting became
                        a way for me to heal, providing a creative outlet that
                        helped ease my worries and lifted me out of the
                        depression and stress of constant transitions. It took
                        me back to that happy place I had as a child, and I
                        realized that painting, for me, is a form of healing.

                        <br /><br />

                        &emsp; My first paintings were two 4x5-foot canvases.
                        Both my husband and Jackie were a bit puzzled as to why
                        I’d start with such large canvases, but I needed a piece
                        for the expansive wall above the stairs in our home, so
                        I didn’t even consider painting something smaller. My
                        husband encouraged me to buy more canvas after
                        completing my first painting. This decision led me to
                        start creating art for every wall in our home.

                        <br /><br />

                        &emsp; My massage clients began to notice and compliment
                        my paintings, and my family members also expressed their
                        appreciation, I gained more confidence in my work. I
                        sold a few pieces and gave many away to friends and
                        family. When we moved cross-country from Lake Havasu,
                        the couple who bought our home purchased several of my
                        paintings, which were still hanging on the walls. This
                        was the start of my confidence in my artwork.
