                <p>
                    &emsp; As a child, I always loved coloring in coloring
                    books. My grandmother set aside a special spot for me to
                    color, and it became a place where I could escape and let my
                    mind wander to a happy place. My journey into painting on
                    canvas, however, didn't begin until I moved to Lake Havasu
                    due to my husband's job.

                    <br /><br />

                    &emsp; Being a military spouse often means you're constantly
                    on the move, making it difficult to build a stable career.
                    My main profession had been as a massage therapist, and I’ve
                    always seen myself as a healer, with the goal of helping
                    those around me. When we relocated for my husband’s job, I
                    had to start my business from scratch, which made it
                    challenging to make new friends and find stability. It was
                    during this time that I met my friend Jackie, who encouraged
                    me to start painting while I was still trying to establish
                    my massage therapy practice.

                    <br /><br />

                    &emsp; I quickly realized that painting brought me a sense
                    of calm and relief from the anxiety that came with moving
                    and starting over in a new place. Painting became a way for
                    me to heal, providing a creative outlet that helped ease my
                    worries and lifted me out of the depression and stress of
                    constant transitions. It took me back to that happy place I
                    had as a child, and I realized that painting, for me, is a
                    form of healing.

                    <br /><br />

                    &emsp; My first paintings were two 4x5-foot canvases. Both
                    my husband and Jackie were a bit puzzled as to why I’d start
                    with such large canvases, but I needed a piece for the
                    expansive wall above the stairs in our home, so I didn’t
                    even consider painting something smaller. My husband
                    encouraged me to buy more canvas after completing my first
                    painting. This decision led me to start creating art for
                    every wall in our home.

                    <br /><br />

                    &emsp; My massage clients began to notice and compliment my
                    paintings, and my family members also expressed their
                    appreciation, I gained more confidence in my work. I sold a
                    few pieces and gave many away to friends and family. When we
                    moved cross-country from Lake Havasu, the couple who bought
                    our home purchased several of my paintings, which were still
                    hanging on the walls. This was the start of my confidence in
                    my artwork.
