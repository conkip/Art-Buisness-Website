                <p class="side-margins">
                    &emsp; As a child, I always loved coloring in coloring
                    books. My grandmother set aside a special spot for me to
                    color, and it became a place where I could escape and
                    let my mind wander to a happy place. My journey into
                    painting on canvas, however, didn't begin until I moved
                    to Lake Havasu due to my husband's job.

                    <br /><br />

                    &emsp; Being a military spouse often means you're
                    constantly on the move, making it difficult to build a
                    stable career. My main profession had been as a massage
                    therapist, and I’ve always seen myself as a healer, with
                    the goal of helping those around me. When we relocated
                    for my husband’s job, I had to start my business from
                    scratch, which made it challenging to make new friends
                    and find stability. It was during this time that I met
                    my friend Jackie, who encouraged me to start painting
                    while I was still trying to establish my massage therapy
                    practice.

                    <br /><br />

                    &emsp; I quickly realized that painting brought me a
                    sense of calm and relief from the anxiety that came with
                    moving and starting over in a new place. Painting became
                    a way for me to heal, providing a creative outlet that
                    helped ease my worries and lifted me out of the
                    depression and stress of constant transitions. It took
                    me back to that happy place I had as a child, and I
                    realized that painting, for me, is a form of healing.

                    <br /><br />

                    &emsp; My first paintings were two 4x5-foot canvases.
                    Both my husband and Jackie were a bit puzzled as to why
                    I’d start with such large canvases, but I needed a piece
                    for the expansive wall above the stairs in our home, so
                    I didn’t even consider painting something smaller. My
                    husband encouraged me to buy more canvas after
                    completing my first painting. This decision led me to
                    start creating art for every wall in our home.

                    <br /><br />

                    &emsp; My massage clients began to notice and compliment
                    my paintings, and my family members also expressed their
                    appreciation, I gained more confidence in my work. I
                    sold a few pieces and gave many away to friends and
                    family. When we moved cross-country from Lake Havasu,
                    the couple who bought our home purchased several of my
                    paintings, which were still hanging on the walls. This
                    was the start of my confidence in my artwork.
