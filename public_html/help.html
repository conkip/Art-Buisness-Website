        • Navigate pages by clicking on the name in the navigation bar. It stays on the top when you scroll.
        <br><br>
        • On the homepage you may click to login at the bottom and read the title and website description
        <br><br>
        • When in the Gallery page, scroll down to see all the artwork along with their names, price, and sizes.
        You may click on an image of a painting to see a more detailed view.

        <br><br>

        In this detailed view you may place a bid on a painting by typing into the text field and 
        clicking enter or the bid button. You also may favorite or unfavorite a painting by clicking 
        the heart Icon. Red means favorited.

        <br><br>

        If you go to your profile, you can see your favorited artwork and the artwork you are currently 
        bidding on.

        <br><br>

        Finally, the about section has a little blurb about Kasey, and the contact page has her contact
        information.
