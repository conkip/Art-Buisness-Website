very cool

TODO: the login is still not quite working correctly, supposed to set cookies and go back to home if true
need to add stuff in js for each page on startup where it gets the cookie (theres a route for that)
and if its null it displays what should be for the guest, if its not it displays what is stored for that user

ex- index- hide login button where it doesnt take space in the scene (either visibility or display does that)
if the user is logged in, otherwise, hide logout button

profile- show users favorited stuff and bids

for bidding and favoriting, need to add a route to add that to the current users faved or bidded paintings. If cookie username is null, dont allow and give message, like done in login.

have the bid and favorite thing display propperly based on user and img when you zoom in.
