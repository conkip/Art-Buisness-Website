TODO: need to add stuff in js for each page on startup where it gets the cookie (theres a route for that)
and if its null it displays what should be for the guest, if its not it displays what is stored for that user

profile- show users favorited stuff and bids

for bidding and favoriting, need to add a route to add that to the current users faved or bidded paintings. If cookie username is null, dont allow and give message, like done in login.

have the bid and favorite thing display propperly based on user and img when you zoom in.

have the dates work for when a bid expires

have a sold section to the gallery
-apply slight gray filter
have price in red/ crossed out
