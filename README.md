very cool

idea to dynamically change painting size:
1. divide the desired height by the total height
2. multiply the width and height by that

or

divide width by height to get ratio
multiply that by desired height to get width

descriptions of art could include size, date, artist, type (ex- acrylic on canvas), and price


possibly-
add sorting the galery based on: (high->low and low->high)
price
size
date
